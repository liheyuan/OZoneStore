Why OZoneStore?
===============
Yes, there are already key-value databases. But those hardly meet demands at KeSeek.com. KeSeek.com is an distributed search engine that built upon many low-end-virtual-machines. 

We DO need a store solution to fulfill the following demands:

(1) Use RAM as less as it can be
Because the cost, we need to support put/get 100,000 documents on a machine that RAM is under 32MB. It sounds funny, but very important for KeSeek.com. Nearly no no-sql may achieve this. Instead, many nosql dbs use lots of Cache to speed up lookup, which is not very
important for an search engine, see DONT'S (1).

(2) Less Disk I/O Operation
Our virtual machines are usually shared with lots of users. We try to build our system over different Host-Machins.
But the Disk I/O is still expensive for we don't have any RAM for cache like other nosql databses. Also, thanks to the
architecture of KeSeek.com, we seperate crawler(put doc) and serach(get doc) in totally different stage, which means
we don't need to update key/value while read docs. So we use an static sorted array to keep all keys.

(3) It can suppourt at least Python and C & C++
We decide to develop OZoneStore in C & C++. But KeSeek.com is major used Python. So, thrift is used to solve
cross-language problem.

(4) An unique key
An unique DocID for every document perferd to be pre-generated before index. Only a small frantion of nosql suppout
incremental ID. We implement this in OZoneStore.

Also, we DON'T need some feature as other nosql provided.

(1) Cache to speed up key->value lookup
Search engine need only to get value from key at the stage of display result & snippet to users. The docs to get is rather random
and usually 10 at once, which is not so performance demand. Pure one Disk I/O per key & value is enough to fulfill
this demand. We'd like to save some RAM and bring our Search Engine cost down.

(2) ...?

Why it is called OZoneStore?
===========================
I'd like to name each my open source project an molecule in air for all KeSeek.com sub-project. OZone is O3 that bring
fresh. I'd like use ozone to name it for indicated swift, fresh and samll.
